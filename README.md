# Haydn

This is a project written in [Alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda), a music programming language. I'm translating the first movement of Haydn's Sonata No. 60 in C Major into code.

## Running the code

You'll need the latest release of Alda, which you can install by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda#installation).

Once Alda is installed, start Alda in the background by running:

<code>alda up</code>

## Playing the music

Navigate to the directory where the code is located and type the following:

<code>alda play --file haydn.alda</code>
